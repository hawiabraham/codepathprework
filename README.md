A challenge I faced in creating this submission was that my project stopped playing clues in the middle of the game. Initially, I joined the Slack in order to get help in figuring out what was wrong but I decided I would try to figure it out myself. I decided to look through the directions carefully and figure out what I was missing. Sometimes the best way to solve a bug is by starting over, so I deleted my code and began anew. I realized I had written some functions out of order, affecting how a function ran. Because other functions were dependent on one another, this was an important mistake to catch. Additionally, I forgot a line of code in the startGame function. This affects the program's ability to keep track of guesses, causing the program to incorrectly display “Game over.” These were simple mistakes, but seriously affected the program. I learned just how meticulous one has to be when it comes to being a programmer. I am proud that I decided to tackle to bug by myself because it strengthened my confidence and ability to take on problems and solve them. I am excited to continue to strengthen my skills as a programmer in this program. I believe that I have a solid foundation to start on.

This was my first experience with web development so I am really proud of myself for what I was able to accomplish and excited to learn more about web development. A question I have after completing this is the distinctions between html, css, and javascript. I would like to know more about their respective capabilities and how they interact with each other to build the website. I would also like to know about more features of html, css, and javascript. I have some ideas for cool websites and would love the opportunity to bring them to life, thanks to my newly learned skills. 


If I had a few more hours to work on this project I would try to see if I could make the program cleaner and decompose functions. I would sort through the code in JavaScript and add more comments in attempts to make it more readable and user-friendly. I would also work on making the images on the buttons not visible until the player clicks on them. I had trouble figuring out how to implement that so if I had more time I would dedicate myself to finding more resources on hiding elements in CSS. Lastly, I would try to add more creative elements to the game by trying to manipulate the background, the music, and the layout of the page.
